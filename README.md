# 2048game
A learning project to implement **2048 - The Game** using test-driven development 

# How to Run the Tests
## Prerequisites
To run the tests, you need to have Node.js installed with npm.
## Code
Run the following from the project root to install the dependencies
`npm install`
Then run an individual test by calling the node script that will run mocha
`npm test <path to the test file>`[^1]
[^1] `test` in the command here is a reference to the script `test` in `package.json`. If mocha was installed globally, you could run `mocha <path to the test file`
